# Lightning in a Bottle

This is a fun and simple game where your goal is to catch as many fireflies as possible by clicking on them before the time runs out! This project was created with Python's Pygame library, featuring original pixel art.

## Gameplay

The game starts with fireflies randomly appearing on the screen. They flicker and move around, so timing is essential! You have **45 seconds** to catch as many fireflies as you can by clicking on them.

### Scoring

- **Catch a firefly:** Each firefly you catch increases your score.
- **Final Score:** At the end of 45 seconds, your score will display based on the total number of fireflies caught.

## Features

- **Original Pixel Art:** All artwork, including the firefly sprites, was created specifically for this game.
- **Randomized Movement:** Fireflies move around the screen randomly, making each game unique and challenging.
- **Dynamic Flickering:** The fireflies periodically flicker, making them feel more alive and challenging to catch.

## Installation

To run Firefly Catcher, make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame by running:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Then, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/firefly-catcher.git
cd firefly-catcher
```

Then, run the game with

```bash
python Launch.py
```

## Skills Used

This project involved a combination of skills across programming, game development, and art:

- **Python:** The main programming language used to build the game logic and handle interactions.
- **Pygame:** A Python library used to create the game window, manage events, and handle graphics, movement, and animation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The game's structure is organized using classes, which helps manage different game entities like the fireflies and player actions.
- **Pixel Art:** Original pixel art was created specifically for the game to give it a unique, retro-inspired aesthetic.
- **Game Development Fundamentals:** The project incorporates essential game development concepts, including timers, scoring, and randomness in enemy movement.
